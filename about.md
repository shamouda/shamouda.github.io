I am a post-doctoral researcher at [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en/), Paris. 
I work with [Marc Shapiro](https://pages.lip6.fr/Marc.Shapiro/) on the design of high-level programming models for geo-replicated databases. 

I completed my PhD studies at the [Australian National University](http://www.anu.edu.au/) in 2019
under the primary supervision of [Dr. Josh Milthorpe](http://www.milthorpe.org/).
I am also grateful to my thesis advisors [Prof. Steve Blackburn](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~steveb/), and [Assoc/Prof. Peter Strazdins](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~peter/).
My PhD thesis title is **'Resilience in High-Level Parallel Programming Languages'**, where 
I addressed issues related to performance and productivity of resilient runtime systems.
In particular, I worked on enhancing the resilience support of the [X10 language](http://x10-lang.org/) in collaboration with the X10 team at IBM T. J. Watson Research center.
