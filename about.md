I am a research engineer at Google DeepMind interested in resilience and memory management research.
I completed my PhD at the [Australian National University](http://www.anu.edu.au/) in 2019
under the primary supervision of [Dr. Josh Milthorpe](http://www.milthorpe.org/).
My [PhD thesis](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/164137) title is **'Resilience in High-Level Parallel Programming Languages'**, where 
I addressed issues related to performance and productivity of resilient runtime systems.

In particular, I worked on enhancing the resilience support of the [X10 language](http://x10-lang.org/) in collaboration with the X10 team at IBM T. J. Watson Research center.
Between my PhD and joining Google, I worked as a post-doctoral researcher at [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en/) Paris, where I studied programming and resilience models of eventually consistent geo-replicated databases.
